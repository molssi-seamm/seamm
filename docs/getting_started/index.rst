Installation
============
The SEAMM package is probably already installed in your SEAMM environment, but
if not or if you wish to check, follow the directions for the `SEAMM Installer`_. The
graphical installer is the easiest to use. In the SEAMM conda environment, simply type::

  seamm-installer

or use the shortcut if you installed one. Switch to the second tab, `Components`, and
check for `seamm`. If it is not installed, or can be updated, check the box
next to it and click `Install selected` or `Update selected` as appropriate.

The non-graphical installer is also straightforward::

  seamm-installer install --update seamm

will ensure both that it is installed and up-to-date.

Put an example or two here....

That should be enough to get started. For more detail about the functionality in this plug-in, see the :ref:`User Guide <user-guide>`.
